Frontend Design Prompt: AI-Powered Campaign Strategist Platform
Project Overview
Design a complete web application for an autonomous AI campaign strategist platform that transforms high-level marketing briefs into fully-executable, multi-step campaign workflows. The platform uses a node-based visual workflow editor where users can customize, connect, and execute specialized AI modules to generate comprehensive brand campaigns.

Problem Context
Business Challenge: Small marketing teams and startups struggle with the complex, time-consuming process of creating complete brand campaigns. Current solutions require multiple tools, specialized expertise, and significant manual coordination.

Solution: A unified platform where users input a single marketing brief (e.g., "Launch a social media campaign for our new sustainable coffee brand targeting Gen Z in Mumbai for World Environment Day") and receive an intelligently-curated workflow of AI modules that autonomously generate strategy, content, visuals, schedules, and execution plans.

Core System Architecture
Module System (12 Specialized AI Modules)
The platform contains 12 specialized modules that can be connected together on a visual canvas:​

Content Generation Modules:

visual_asset_generator - Generates images using AI models

video_content_generator - Creates video content from scripts/images

copy_content_generator - Writes marketing copy and captions

Analysis & Planning Modules:
4. audience_intelligence_analyzer - Analyzes target audience characteristics
5. campaign_timeline_optimizer - Creates optimized campaign timelines

Scheduling Modules (Planning Only):
6. content_distribution_scheduler - Plans content posting schedules (does NOT publish)
7. outreach_call_scheduler - Plans call schedules (does NOT make calls)

Execution Modules (Action Implementation):
8. content_distribution_executor - Actually publishes scheduled content
9. voice_interaction_agent - Makes calls and conducts conversations

Research & Engagement Modules:
10. lead_discovery_engine - Discovers and qualifies leads
11. collaboration_outreach_composer - Composes personalized outreach messages

Integration Module:
12. external_api_orchestrator - Universal connector for third-party APIs

How Modules Work
Module Structure: Each module is a self-contained AI agent with defined inputs, outputs, and processing logic. Modules appear as visual nodes on the canvas with input ports (left side) and output ports (right side).​

Input Ports: Accept specific data types (strings, objects, arrays, enums). Each port displays the parameter name and required/optional indicator.

Output Ports: Emit processed data that can be connected to other modules. Multiple modules can consume the same output.

Module States: Modules have visual indicators showing their status: not configured (gray), configured (blue), executing (animated blue), success (green), failed (red), partial success (yellow).

Parameter Configuration: Clicking a module opens a side panel where users can view/edit all input parameters. Parameters can be manually entered or automatically filled when connected to another module's output.​

Canvas Connectivity Model
Edge-Based Connections: Modules connect via directed edges (lines) that visually represent data flow from one module's output port to another module's input port.​

Connection Rules:

Edges flow left-to-right (source → target)

Output ports can connect to multiple inputs (one-to-many)

Input ports accept only compatible data types

The canvas validates connections in real-time and shows error indicators for type mismatches

Users can hover over edges to see the data being transferred

Sequential Flow: Data flows through connected modules in order. A module only executes after all its required inputs are satisfied.

Parallel Branches: Multiple modules can execute simultaneously if they receive the same input from a parent module.

Conditional Paths: Some modules output boolean/enum values that determine which downstream path executes.

Technical Workflow Process
Step 1: Brief Submission
User enters marketing brief on Campaign Brief Input page → Backend AI processes brief → Backend returns curated workflow JSON specifying:

Which modules to include

Initial module positioning

Pre-configured parameter values

Suggested connections between modules

Step 2: Workflow Customization
Frontend renders workflow on canvas → User can:

Add/remove modules from library

Rearrange module positions

Create/delete connections by dragging between ports

Modify parameters in configuration panel

System validates connections ensure data type compatibility

Step 3: Workflow Execution
User clicks execute → Frontend sends complete workflow graph to backend → Backend orchestrates module execution respecting dependency order → Frontend receives real-time execution updates via WebSocket → Progress reflected on canvas and execution monitor

Step 4: Results & Approval
All modules complete → Frontend displays results review page → User approves/modifies outputs → Approved campaigns move to execution phase where scheduling modules trigger executor modules

Visual Design Considerations
Canvas Interactions: Should feel smooth with 60fps animations, rubber-band edge drawing, magnetic snapping when ports align, keyboard shortcuts for power users.​

Responsive Behavior: Canvas editor optimized for desktop (minimum 1280px width). Mobile shows read-only workflow view with scrollable module list.

Data Type Visualization: Use consistent color coding (strings=blue, objects=purple, arrays=green, enums=orange) across ports, edges, and documentation.​

Progressive Disclosure: Don't overwhelm users with all 12 modules initially. Show commonly used modules by default with "Show all" expansion.

Error Handling: Clear visual feedback for validation errors, connection incompatibilities, execution failures with actionable resolution steps.

Loading States: Skeleton screens for canvas loading, shimmer effects for executing modules, progress bars for long operations.

This platform transforms complex campaign creation into an intuitive, visual, AI-powered workflow experience.
